# loopback-component-cas

This module provides integration between [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) and [Passport](http://passportjs.org) to support Central Authentication Service (CAS) login for LoopBack applications.

It is based off `loopback-component-passport` and has been created to work
in situations when only CAS authentication is deired.  It does not support a number of the features (e.g. account linking) that are provided by `loopback-component-passport`.

## Installation

`npm install --save @rula/loopback-component-cas`
